// Content for the /vs-hermes-kanban/ page — kanban skill vs. Hermes Agent Kanban.
// Kept apart from the home page's content.ts and the GitHub comparison's
// vs-content.ts so each page evolves on its own.
//
// Framing (important): compare like for like — the kanban skill on a harness
// (e.g. Claude Code) vs. the Hermes Kanban feature on the Hermes runtime. Both
// harnesses already give you parallel subagents, worktree isolation, fan-out /
// pipeline / voting, human-in-the-loop, transcripts, and a dashboard, so those
// wash out. What's genuinely specific to Hermes Kanban is the durable, shared
// SQLite work queue (many named agents + humans claim tasks; crash recovery) and
// dispatcher-run auto-decomposition. What's specific to the skill is being plain
// diffable files, agent-agnostic (it even runs on Hermes), and zero infra.

export type HkEdge = "kanban" | "hermes" | "neutral";

// The side-by-side matrix. `edge` marks the winning cell with a check and the
// other with a cross; a "neutral" row is a deliberate trade-off — both sides get
// a dash, because it comes down to what you need rather than one being worse.
// Agent-runtime compatibility isn't a row here — it gets its own logo-bar
// section (HkHarness), which reads faster than prose in a table cell.
