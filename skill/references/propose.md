# Propose new tasks

Pick a module, then propose **3 new tasks inside it**. New work, not picks from the
board — tasks in one focus close a gap; scattered ideas just skim the product.

## 1. Pick the module

Read `docs/kanban/modules.md` and repair any line that
disagrees with the repo (no map? build it per `references/module-map.md`).

**Ask the user to pick one or more modules from the map.** If they leave it open, pick
one yourself — the one where memory says users stumble most.

Once you have a focus module, its memory set lives at `docs/kanban/memory/<module>/` (keyed
by its bolded name in `modules.md`) — the five files described in "The memory set" in
`SKILL.md`. Read that path, not the whole board, so the notes you work from are that
module's: `readme.md` for current status (and shipped behavior not yet documented),
`goal.md` for its direction, `decisions.md` for settled answers you needn't re-open, and
`redesign.md` / `rejected.md` to avoid wrong designs and re-proposals. To see what already
shipped, read the module's **published docs** — shipped behavior is recorded there, not in
memory. A module with no folder yet has no notes. With no focus module or no module map,
read the umbrella set at `docs/kanban/` instead.

**List the cards already tagged with the focus module.** Grep the board for cards whose
`modules:` field names it — `grep -rl 'modules:.*<module>' docs/kanban/todo/` — and read
them, so you don't re-propose planned work and you see where the module already has effort.

## 2. Walk it as a user

Ideas come from a walkthrough, not a feature list. Play one real user story in the
focus, step by step. At each step ask: what can't they see or find? what do they wait
on, guess at, or redo by hand? Every stumble is a task idea.

Then check the focus's written sources — the code, roadmap doc, user-facing docs
(Configuration, where shipped behavior is recorded), `todo/`, `rejected.md`, and the focus
module's memory (from step 1, `readme.md` included) — to catch promised work and stop
re-proposals.

## 3. Propose 3 tasks

All inside the focus; none already on the board, already shipped (in the published docs or
`readme.md`), or in `rejected.md` (unsure one is already done? run the check in
`references/task-review.md`). Write each
with the "Add a task" flow in `SKILL.md`.

## 4. Record

Overwrite the focus module's `readme.md` (`docs/kanban/memory/<module>/readme.md`) with the
current status so the next loop skips re-reading: where users stumbled (keep the gap, drop
the details), a review watermark per source, and this loop's focus so the next one rotates.
If the module has no folder yet, run `node .claude/skills/kanban/kanban.mjs memory-init
<module>` first to create its set. For umbrella-wide work with no focus module, or a project
with no module map, write the umbrella `readme.md` at `docs/kanban/readme.md` instead. Prune
stale notes.
